# ICS4U-Final-Project

This project is the final project for Ms. Luces ICS4U-03 Computer Science class by Jordan Yang, Vinit Rao and John Matthew. Our project is a Receipt Scanner, an image scanning application using Tesseract OCR to identify text in images. This text will be printed into a seperate text file. Our project will have a GUI consisting of a prompt to enter the file name, the program will then search for an image file of that name in a corresponding folder. If successful, the image will be scanned and its text will be printed into a text file that will be created in another folder.
